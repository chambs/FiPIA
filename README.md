## First Project In Ages

As it is been a long time I don't write anything on GitHub, I have decided to create this all purpose repository.

## Some Reasons to do this

1. Although I haven't written anything on Github, doesn't mean I haven't learned anything new
2. For the past 2 years or so, I have still worked with Javascript mainly, especially in the client side
3. But, I have never gave up on Node. Actually, I still think NodeJS is great, fun and it pisses old cavemen developers off, which I think is cool
4. There is a couple of new things I think are nice, and are worth learning, exploring and saving on Github as reference, and for sharing, of course
5. There is a couple of new things which I think is garbage, overrated or I simply think it is not interesting to me.
6. There is a couple of old stuff I still think is cool. Some of them have progressed, some did not, and some, I don't even know how it is going. eg: requireJS
7. I am very excited about ES6
8. I am very excited about HTML5, specifically MSE and EME. Also, I need them on my new job!
9. I have got rusted on Git/Github, so this is also a great opportunity to get back to it. I know, it's embarassing, but I was working for almost 2 years with the shitty Perforce
10. There are probably some other reasonable reasons, but I can't remember right now :)

Cheers!
Willian
